> **Hydron works fully on its own.** For players who want maximum clarity and consistent lighting, it can optionally be paired with [**Photon**](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/photon-fullbright).

## Features
- Clearer underwater visibility without removing water effects  
- Reduced blue tint and fog for cleaner oceans, rivers, and caves  
- Vanilla-consistent visuals with no FullBright or night-vision behavior  
- Fully server-friendly, no gameplay advantages or shaders  

---

## Why Hydron?
Underwater exploration shouldn’t feel like looking through fogged glass. Hydron makes oceans, rivers, and flooded caves easier to navigate while keeping water natural and immersive. Lightweight, subtle, and designed to feel native to vanilla Minecraft.
